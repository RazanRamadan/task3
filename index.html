<h1>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h1>
<p class="gray_p">The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer 
     a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.

    I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds  
    about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportuinities.
    
    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
    
    A qoute I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
    
    "How big would you dream, if you knew you would't fail?"
    You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills 
     and become a leader in something you're passionate about.
    
    I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company. </p>
